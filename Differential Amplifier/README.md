# Differential Amplifier 
A differential amplifier is an electronic circuit that amplifies the difference between two input voltages while rejecting any voltage common to both inputs. It is the basic building block of operational amplifiers (op-amps) and is widely used in analog systems and instrumentation amplifiers

The differential amplifier operates with two inputs, commonly labeled `Vin+` and `Vinâˆ’`, and an output `Vout`.  
The relationship between input and output voltages is given by:

$$
V_{out} = A \times (V_{in}^{+} - V_{in}^{-})
$$
