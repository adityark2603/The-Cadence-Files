# N-CNFET 
N-CNFETs (N-type Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistor) are transistors that use semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the channel material instead of silicon. These devices offer several advantages over traditional MOSFETs due to their unique one-dimensional transport properties and high carrier mobility.
