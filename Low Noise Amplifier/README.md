# Low-Noise-Amplifier
A Low Noise Amplifier designed using Cadence Virtuoso tool

A Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) is an electronic amplifier designed to amplify very weak signals (usually in the RF/microwave range) without adding significant noise. It is typically the first stage in a receiver chain (like in radios, satellite, or radar systems).

## Applications of LNA:
1. Wireless communication systems (WiFi, 5G, Bluetooth)
2. Satellite receivers
3. Radar systems
4. Radio telescopes
5. IoT and sensor-based systems

## Working Principle
When a signal is received by an antenna, it's often very weakâ€”sometimes just a few microvolts. Before this signal can be processed (filtered, demodulated, or digitized), it needs to be amplified without degrading the quality. The LNA performs this task by providing:

1. High gain: Boosts the amplitude of the incoming signal.
2. Low noise figure (NF): Ensures minimal noise is added during amplification.
3. Input/output matching: Matches impedance with the antenna and following circuits to minimize reflection losses.
