# Monte Carlo Analysis
Monte Carlo analysis is a statistical simulation technique used to evaluate how process variations (like threshold voltage, channel length, mobility, etc.) affect the performance of a circuit. In CMOS design, especially for inverters, this analysis is critical because even small mismatches can lead to significant deviations in behavior.

### Importance of Monte Carlo Analysis for CMOS Inverter
1. It helps in identifying worst-case scenarios and ensuring that the inverter works reliably under all possible variations.
2. Monte Carlo analysis uses random sampling of these variations based on statistical distributions (typically Gaussian) to model real-world manufacturing behavior.
3. Monte Carlo analysis allows you to predict the yield (percentage of chips that will function correctly after fabrication) by checking how many simulations meet the design specifications.
