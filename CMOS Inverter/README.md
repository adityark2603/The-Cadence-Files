# CMOS-Inverter
A Simple CMOS inverter implemented in Cadence Virtuoso tool


A CMOS inverter is a fundamental logic gate in digital circuits, built using a p-channel (PMOS) and an n-channel (NMOS) MOSFET in a complementary configuration. It functions as a NOT gate, inverting the input signal.
## Operation:

1. Input = High (1) → NMOS conducts, PMOS is off → Output = Low (0)
2. Input = Low (0) → PMOS conducts, NMOS is off → Output = High (1)
