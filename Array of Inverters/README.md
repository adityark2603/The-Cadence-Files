# Array of Inverters
An array of inverters is multiple NOT gates (inverters) connected either in series or laid out in parallel within a circuit. These arrays are commonly used for:
1. Signal buffering: Strengthening weak signals to drive larger loads.
2. Delay elements: Each inverter introduces a small delay, so a chain of inverters can be used to create precise time delays.
3. Ring oscillators: An odd number of inverters connected in a loop can produce an oscillating signal.
4. Noise filtering: Helps reshape degraded signals back into sharp digital waveforms.
