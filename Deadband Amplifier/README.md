# Deadband Amplifier
A deadband amplifier is a type of amplifier that introduces a "dead zone" or non-responsive region around a certain input range. Within this deadband region, small input signals produce no output response. Only when the input exceeds a certain threshold does the amplifier begin to respond and amplify the signal.
