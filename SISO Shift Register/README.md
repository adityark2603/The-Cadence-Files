## 4 Bit SISO Shift Register
A 4-bit SISO (Serial-In Serial-Out) shift register is a sequential digital circuit that stores 4 bits of data and shifts them one bit at a time from input to output with each clock pulse.

### Key Components
1. Serial Input: Data enters one bit at a time
2. Clock: Synchronizes all flip-flops simultaneously
3. D Flip-Flops: Store and shift data bits
4. Serial Output: Data exits from the last flip-flop
